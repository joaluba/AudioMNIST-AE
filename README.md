# AudioMNIST-AE

This repository presents a pytorch project: autoencoder which encodes log-spectrograms of audio files into a lower-dimensional space and decodes it back to log-spectrograms. A convolutional autoencoder is trained using a small data set (Audio MNIST). 

The main notebook can be found in notebooks/prep.ipynb and the methods used in the notebook can be found in src folder.
